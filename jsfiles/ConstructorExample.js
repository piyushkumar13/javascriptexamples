/**
 * The advantage of constructors is that objects created with the same constructor contain the same proper- ties and methods.
 * If you want to create multiple similar objects, you can create your own constructors and therefore your own reference types.
 * Note : You can also explicitly call return inside of a constructor. If the returned value is an object, it will be returned instead
 * of the newly created object instance. If the returned value is a primitive, the newly created object is used and the returned
 * value is ignored.
